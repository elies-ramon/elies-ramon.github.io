      I was in charge of several epidemiological studies on how microbiome and previous diseases influence the risk of cancer. My role entailed mentoring our Ph.D. students and performing statistical analyses and classical machine learning approaches, for the following projects:
      - inSCAN: Big data project - Extraction, cleaning and statistical analysis of the PADRIS dataset (electronic health records from 150000 cancer cases diagnosed in Catalonia between 2012-2017, plus 1.5 million matched controls).
      - FUSOMAP: Statistical analysis of the prevalence, geographical distribution, and prognostic risk of F. nucleatum infection.
      - Fundació La Marató de TV3 (Ref.202127-31): Microbiota composition as risk predictor in cancer patients infected with COVID.
