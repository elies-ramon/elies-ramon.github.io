      title: Selected Projects
      text: I enjoy making things. Here you can see a selection of projects that I have worked on over the years. If you have any questions, please open a GitHub issue or email me. I consider the following packages to be my main packages. This is because I am not only their primary author and mantainer, but I also have expertise in the methods implemented.

* `kerntools`: Covariate Balance Tables and Plots
  - Elies Ramon | [website](https://elies-ramon.github.io/kerntools) | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kerntools/index.html) | [source](https://github.com/elies-ramon/kerntools/)
* `kernInt`: Kernel Integration of Microbiome Analysis Methods & Data
  - Elies Ramon| [website](https://ngreifer.github.io/WeightIt) | [source](hhttps://github.com/elies-ramon/kernInt)

Besides, I have also proposed modifications to other R packages:

* `sva-devel`: Surrogate Variable Analysis
  -  Yuqing Zhang, Jeff L. | [Pull Request](https://github.com/jtleek/sva-devel/pull/58)
